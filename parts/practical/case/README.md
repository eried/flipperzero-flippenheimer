The case can be printed without supports. Orient the flat part of both parts to the bottom. It is recommended to print a test piece first of the *back.stl* part and calibrate the width depending on your printer. Resize the width of both pieces (ie. 99% if is too loose around the PCB, 101% if is too tight).
